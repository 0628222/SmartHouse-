## Smart House 
 I decided to create a smart house using the sonar to check if somebody is nearby, locking the door until the servo is used and the door is unlocked. The crash button will be a doorbell. The potentiometers control the brightness of the traffic light LEDs. 
## Behaviours

PIR will be used in order to check where the people are in the house and outside of the house and then flashes the traffic light leds 
Sd reports all of the functions and the input and outputs 
Crash button is doorbell and piezo is response from	
When anything happens log event 
Potentiometers calculate the brightness of the traffic lights leds
Keypad in door to unlock front door 


1. Line sensor is used for a automatic door opener which detects and then the dc motor activates

2. PIR will check where people are and if the system is turned on then it will see if people are outside and then trigger the LEDS to activate

3. The SD card will log all of the inputs and outputs 

4. Crash Button is the doorbell and the Peizo is the sound it makes 

5. Potetiometers caculate the brightness of the LEds

6. Keypad on the front door in order to unlock
